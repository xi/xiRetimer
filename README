xiRetimer v 0.2

breaks an audio file into pieces, timestretches and reconcatenates them. 
I want to use this to fit recorded Audio exactly to a tempo.

playback - sdl
gui - wxwidgets
xiRetimer
timestretch - rubberband (v>=1.5)


TODO
rubberband crashes
smooth interpolation
always update gui
libmad
exits with error
soundtouch
bugtracking
